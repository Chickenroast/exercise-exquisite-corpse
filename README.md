# IM NOT BATMAN

## some days i would like to drive like him
But i dont know how to drive

### I wish be maried with a bat 

In my dreams, I soar through the night skies, but in reality, I'm just an ordinary person. The Batmobile remains a fantasy, and my heart longs for a love as deep as the Dark Knight's commitment to Gotham. Yet, for now, I'll embrace my uniqueness and write my own story, even if I'm not Batman.
